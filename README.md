# STA_309_Midterm2_earthquakes
Github repository for STA 309 midterm 2


Tasked to tell a story with earthquake data from 1965-2016 by building a dashboard
  so, I chose to look at the March 11, 2011 Tōhoku, Japan earthquake.
The greatest number of earthquakes that occured in a day (in this data) was this earthquake,
  and it was significantly more occurances than other days.
Interested in what the aftershock of it looks like on a map 
  and the pattern after the initial earthquake. 
Aftershock here is defined as "nearby" (general vacinity of initial earthquake) 
  earthquakes for the next week (ie from 3-12-2011 to 3-18-2011).

General takeways from the dashboard:
1. The earthquake in Tōhoku, Japan was significant
2. The aftershock of the earthquake overlapped where the initial earthquake hit
3. The number of earthquakes that occured per day decreased throughout the week following the initial earthquake
