# STA_309_Midterm2_earthquakes
Github repository for STA 309 midterm 2


Tasked to tell a story with earthquake data from 1965-2016 by building a dashboard
  so, I chose to look at the March 11, 2011 Tōhoku, Japan earthquake.
The greatest number of earthquakes that occured in a day (in this data) was this earthquake,
  and it was significantly more occurances than other days.
Interested in what the aftershock of it looks like on a map 
  and the pattern after the initial earthquake. 
Aftershock here is defined as "nearby" (general vacinity of initial earthquake) 
  earthquakes for the next week (ie from 3-12-2011 to 3-18-2011).
 I am comparing it to the earthquake in the Indian Ocean 12/26/2004 because
  both earthquakes reached a magnitude of 9.1, there were many occurances of earthquakes in the 
  same day as the initial shock, both caused a tsunami, and happened around the same time. 

General takeways from the dashboard:
1. The earthquake in Tōhoku, Japan was significant
2. The aftershock of the earthquake surrounds where the initial earthquake hit
3. The number of earthquakes that occured per day decreased throughout the week following the initial earthquake for Japan and the Indian ocean
